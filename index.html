        <h2>About Get Into AI</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Get Into AI</strong> is a Bangor University initiative. It is
          an EPSRC-funded Landscape AI Skills Programme led by Bangor
          University, starting October 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project aims to increase awareness, engagement, and diversity in
          artificial intelligence (AI) skills, with a particular focus on
          schools in North Wales, while also reaching wider audiences through
          public events and an online campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get Into AI is designed to inspire learners from school age through to
          postgraduate level to explore AI concepts, tools, and career pathways.
          A core priority of the project is widening participation, particularly
          through inclusive, creative, and hands-on approaches to AI education.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Get Into AI pilots innovative ways of teaching and experiencing AI,
          combining:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hands-on activities and physical computing</li>
          <li>Creative coding and playful learning</li>
          <li>Public engagement and outreach</li>
          <li>Real-world AI tools and applications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The project aligns closely with EPSRC objectives, supporting skills
          development, creativity, and responsible engagement with AI
          technologies.

        <h2>Work Packages</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Get Into AI</strong> project is structured into eight Work
          Packages (WPs), each targeting a specific aspect of outreach,
          education, and engagement in AI skills.
        </p>

        <h3>
          WP1 -
          <a href="https://www.technocamps.com/en/team/bangor/">Technocamps:</a>
          AI in Schools
        </h3>
        <p>
          We engage with local school students through visits, classroom
          activities, and teacher training. This work package places a strong
          emphasis on Welsh-medium schools, introducing core AI concepts in
          accessible and age-appropriate ways.
        </p>

        <h3>WP2 - AI Starter Kit for Schools</h3>
        <p>
          We are delivering hands-on AI starter kits based on Micro:bit
          technology to local schools. These kits enable students to explore
          coding, electronics, and creative computing while developing
          foundational AI skills.
        </p>

        <h3>WP3 - Community AI Skills & Creative Coding Day</h3>
        <p>
          We are running several public workshops and tutorials that introduce
          AI, creative computing, and design thinking to a broad audience,
          supporting lifelong learning and community engagement.
        </p>

        <h3>WP4 - Get Into AI: Online Campaign & Resources</h3>
        <p>
          We are developing an online hub of openly licensed educational
          resources, including videos, web-based tools, and outreach materials.
          This work package places a strong emphasis on diversity, inclusion,
          and widening participation.
        </p>

        <h3>WP5 - LEGO Schools</h3>
        <p>
          Provides interactive, LEGO-based AI demonstrations in schools,
          combining creative play with learning AI concepts. Activities are
          designed to be engaging, accessible, and suitable for Welsh-medium
          contexts.
        </p>

        <h3>WP6 - AI Hackathon</h3>
        <p>
          Organises an AI hackathon where students collaborate to apply AI tools
          to real-world challenges. The hackathon fosters creativity, teamwork,
          and awareness of AI-related careers.
          <b>The student-facing hackathon will run 6-7 March 2026</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>WP7 - ML Look & Move</h3>
        <p>
          Creates a hands-on interactive activity in which participants
          manipulate physical objects on a table. These are tracked by a camera
          and visualised digitally, introducing machine learning and computer
          vision concepts through embodied interaction.
        </p>

        <h3>WP8 - Conference</h3>
        <p>
          Organising the <b>Future AI </b> conference. Joint with NVIDIA, the
          two-day conference will showcase talks, demonstration and training in
          AI. This event celebrates achievements and promotes AI skills to a
          wide audience.
