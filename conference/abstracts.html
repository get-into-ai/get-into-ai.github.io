    <h4 class="talk-title">MSPARC & Egni.ai</h4>
    <div class="talk-abstract">
      <p>At M-SParc, we’ve been building a very practical model of applied AI—one that starts with real-world problems faced by SMEs. One example is Egni.ai, our AI-powered carbon reporting tool. It combines DEFRA emissions factors with large language models to translate complex carbon accounting into clear, auditable carbon footprint reports that SMEs can actually understand and act on. What’s important here isn’t just the tech—it’s accessibility. We’re lowering the barrier to net zero by making compliance, reporting, and decision-making usable for everyday businesses, not just specialists.</p><p>
That model is now evolving. Having proven its value with SMEs across Wales, we’re pivoting Egni.ai into new, data-rich sectors such as sport and agriculture—where emissions data, behavioural change, and real-time insight can unlock huge gains. In agriculture, this means connecting farm-level activity with credible carbon metrics. In sport, it’s about understanding the footprint of clubs, facilities, and events. In both cases, the opportunity is the same: pairing trusted datasets with AI reasoning to move from static reporting to continuous insight—and doing so in a way that is scalable, secure, and grounded in real operational contexts.</p><p> 
Alongside this, we’re leading national research into how Welsh businesses are actually adopting AI. Working with Welsh Government, we’re surveying SMEs across sectors to understand readiness, use cases, risks, skills gaps, and good practice. This is not abstract research—the findings will directly inform a pan-Wales programme of AI support for SMEs. The aim is to ensure adoption is responsible, inclusive, and economically meaningful, while avoiding the familiar trap of AI being either over-hyped or under-used.</p><p>
Finally, M-SParc acts as a living lab for good AI in action. A great example is 42able.ai, whose work in the education sector shows how AI can be deployed ethically, transparently, and at scale to improve outcomes. These kinds of collaborations—between research, industry, and applied infrastructure—are where we see the real opportunity. Wales may be small, but that gives us an advantage: we can connect compute, research, policy, and SMEs into a single, testable ecosystem. That’s the model we’re building—and the one we believe can travel well beyond Wales.</p>

    <h4 class="talk-title">AI, Shadow AI & the Skills Gap</h4>
    <div class="talk-abstract">
      <p>Examines organisational AI adoption, the risks of shadow AI, and the growing digital skills gap facing modern enterprises.</p>
      <p>This talk explores how AI is actually being adopted across organisations today — not as a future roadmap item, but as a present-day reality. Delivered in partnership context with M-SParc and NVIDIA, the talk focuses on AI as a capability and skills shift, rather than a purely technical challenge. The presentation is narrative-led and sector-agnostic, designed for a mixed audience of founders, SMEs, technologists, public-sector leaders, and innovators. </p>
        <p>The talk starts by framing AI as a step-change in how intelligence is accessed and applied. The rapid acceleration of AI capability explains both the opportunity and the unease many organisations are experiencing. AI is briefly demystified through a simple evolutionary lens, giving the audience shared language and confidence without technical depth. The talk reframes AI as a set of reusable capabilities that augment human thinking and decision-making, rather than a collection of standalone tools. With this foundation, the session introduces Shadow AI — the informal, often invisible use of AI by individuals and teams. This is positioned as a natural response to accessible intelligence and unmet skills needs, not a failure of governance. Most AI risk and missed value is shown to stem from gaps in literacy, confidence, and understanding — not from the absence of platforms or policies. The talk concludes with a human-centred approach to AI adoption: build understanding first, enable safe experimentation, develop skills across roles, and allow strategy and tooling to follow.

    <div class="talk-abstract">
      <p>This work presents gVirtualXray (gVXR), a GPU‑accelerated simulation framework X-ray imaging. It can produce a high number of realistic simulated images to train machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks, which would not have been possible a few years ago. Early examples of applications include (i) the estimation of the length statistics of aggregate fried potato products, (ii) the creation of generative adversarial networks to generate X-ray radiographs from photographs of hands, and (iii) the study of real-time edge-aware denoising in fluoroscopic devices. Nowadays, gVXR is widely used in data augmentation, particularly for image segmentation tasks such as (i) lung nodule detection in 2D radiographs, (ii) segmentation of woven carbon fibre reinforced woven composite, (iii) material decomposition in spectral CT data, (iv) defect detection and characterisation and (v) characterisation of surface roughness for additive manufacturing.</p>

      <p>
        Understanding marine ecosystem functioning requires detailed knowledge of the cryptic
behaviours and interactions of marine predators. Bio-logging technologies (animal-borne
sensors) are increasingly deployed to monitor animal movements, foraging behaviour and
environmental context. However, these technologies generate large, complex and heterogeneous
datasets (multi-dimensional signals sampled at up to 10,000 Hz) that demand robust analytical
frameworks and advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Here, I present two complementary AI-
driven case studies in marine ecology: high-frequency scalar sensor data and underwater image
data, highlighting opportunities for multimodal modelling and edge AI.
First, high-resolution accelerometer tags generate multi-dimensional time-series data that
provide detailed proxies for behaviour but are difficult to interpret at scale. I evaluated
unsupervised and supervised machine-learning approaches on multi-season accelerometer
datasets from penguins, explicitly accounting for inter-individual variability. Expectation
Maximisation clustering was used to generate behavioural labels, which were then used to train
Random Forest classifiers. Incorporating behavioural variability resulted in high agreement
(>80%) between approaches and consistent energy expenditure estimates, although behaviours
with similar signal signatures remained difficult to distinguish, underscoring challenges in
scalable behavioural inference.<p></p>
Second, emerging image-based bio-logging technologies, including animal-borne cameras
and active acoustic systems, provide contextual data on predator–prey interactions and
environmental conditions. Underwater imagery poses unique computer vision challenges such
as variable illumination, colour distortion, motion blur, dynamic backgrounds and scale
variability. I review state-of-the-art computer vision tools for underwater object detection and
tracking, propose a four-phase processing framework (video manipulation, image processing,
image labelling and model development), and discuss integration with scalar sensor data
collected at different temporal resolutions. I further explore lightweight on-board AI models for
real-time inference at the sensor level, enabling edge processing to reduce data storage,
transmission costs and latency.<p></p>
I argue that integrating AI across scalar and image-based bio-logging, using multimodal
models, GPU-accelerated pipelines and edge computing, will transform marine ecological
research and conservation. Such frameworks enable scalable behavioural inference, real-time
ecological monitoring and data-driven conservation decision-making, creating opportunities for
collaboration between ecologists, AI researchers and industry partners in high-performance and
embedded AI systems.</p>

     Marianna is a quantitative ecologist driven by a passion for advancing the fields of ecology, movement ecology, habitat conservation, and species monitoring. She obtained her PhD at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, where she investigated the foraging behaviour of two diving seabird species—common guillemots (Uria aalge) and razorbills (Alca torda)—during their breeding season. Using combined tracking data from GPS, Time Depth Recorders, and accelerometers, she characterised their foraging strategies both above and below the water, identifying common patterns, differences in movement, and distinct hunting strategies.
Since completing her PhD, Marianna has worked with a diverse range of species, including Arctic and Northern Hemisphere seabirds, Arctic terrestrial mammals, Mediterranean marine turtles, and even Antarctic wildlife. Her research broadly focuses on questions related to animal movement processes, responses to environmental change, and the links between movement, population dynamics, and life‑cycle strategies. She uses biological data—such as accelerometers, GPS tags, and SRDL devices—to understand how, where, when, and why animals move.
Marianna is equally enthusiastic about coding and modelling, frequently working with statistical tools and individual‑based models (IBMs). At the same time, she thrives in the field—nothing brings her more joy than hands‑on ecological work outdoors. She is joining the School of Ocean Sciences at Bangor University as Lecturer in Marine Top Predators Ecology, where she looks forward to continuing her research on how changes in the availability of marine resources affect the energetics, fitness, behaviour, decision‑making, and habitat use of marine predators.

      <p> This presentation explores the implications of Artificial Intelligence for today’s law students as future legal professionals. As AI becomes embedded in legal research, drafting, dispute resolution, and advisory work, it is reshaping the skills and responsibilities lawyers will need. The presentation considers how AI may transform access to justice, both expanding affordable legal services and risking digital exclusion and algorithmic bias, while also highlighting the social and environmental impacts of data-intensive technologies. It argues that law students must develop technological literacy alongside strong ethical judgment, critical thinking, and social awareness. Preparing for an AI-enabled profession means not only learning to use new tools, but understanding their broader consequences for fairness, sustainability, and the rule of law.</p>
