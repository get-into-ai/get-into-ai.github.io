          Hackathons are like marathons. Some people go to compete, but most
          people take part to better themselves and have fun. Regardless of why
          you're at a hackathon, remember to uphold the spirit of the hackathon
          by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and enjoying
          yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Registration is essential and <strong>free</strong> of charge. See
          below for details.

        <h2>What to bring</h2>
        <p>
          The Da Vinci Co Lab is a versatile space with University PC access,
          however we recommend that all attendees bring their own laptops or PCs
          with them, including chargers and any peripherals you might need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although all meals, food, and drinks will be provided free of charge
          throughout the event, you are welcome to bring additional food and
          drinks if you wish.
        </p>
        <p>We also recommend you bring the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Laptop and charger</strong> (we have 12 University PCs
            available)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Peripherals, extra cables, and chargers</strong> (you can
            never be too prepared)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sleeping bag</strong> (if you want to nap on a bean bag)
          </li>
          <li><strong>A pillow</strong> (always good to have)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spare clothes</strong> (you'll want to feel fresh for the
            presentations)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Do I need a team?</h2>
        <p>
          Hackathons are team events and we encourage you to form teams on the
          day rather than planning who you will be with beforehand. There will
          be a team-building session before the hacking begins which will give
          you the opportunity to meet other participants and form teams before
          we start. Teams will consist of 3 people.
        </p>

        <h2>This doesn't sound like it's for me</h2>
        <p>Trust us, this event really is for you.</p>
        <p>
          Hackathons are especially good for beginners because they're a
          fantastic place to learn new skills quickly and efficiently from
          others. We are also running talks and workshops during the event where
          you will be able to learn new things and ask questions if you need
          help.
        </p>

          should attend!
